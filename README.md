# Simplified-DES Implementation
A simplified version of DES (Data Encryption Standard) Algorithm. It is designed to demonstrate the encryption process using a minimal version of the DES algorithm.

## Overview
S-DES is used for educational purposes, as it demonstrates the process of key generation, substitution-permutation, and encryption. It operates on 8-bit plaintext and uses a 10-bit key for encryption.
This implementation takes:
- A plaintext (8 bits in binary format)
- A key (10 bits in binary format)

as command line arguments and outputs the corresponding ciphertext. If arguments are not given, two default values for plaintext and key are used.
